## Project Description

This project seeks to understand the interplay between food security, migration, violence, and climate vulnerability in Northern Central America to inform targeted interventions. Key challenges include mapping vulnerability hotspots, predicting migration drivers, and assessing impacts on rural and urban food security in fragile contexts.

## Project Aim & Goals

The main beneficiaries are the World Bank teams, policymakers in Northern Central America, and local communities. This analysis aims to inform sustainable, data-driven strategies to support resilience among food-insecure and vulnerable populations in the region.

The goal is to generate actionable insights and data visualizations on migration patterns, food security vulnerabilities, and resilience-building strategies for communities in fragile areas. The project is focused on both descriptive insights and predictive models to inform targeted policy recommendations.

## Data Description

Approximately 1-2 GB, though this may vary with additional data layers or survey responses in test, time series / panel, and abular format. Primarily Tabular (e.g., survey results, socio-economic indicators), Time Series/Panel data for trends over time, and Text data from qualitative responses. The data includes household survey results, migration statistics, violence indicators, and climate-related variables (e.g., rainfall, temperature). Qualitative data from interviews and focus groups may also be available. Additionally, the project will involve geospatial data analysis, with the student supporting a data fellow as a research assistant on this component.The survey data will be collected in early 2025 so the data could be made available only after that.

## Schedule

Early implementation phase: The World Bank team has completed a preliminary literature review and is now refining data analysis strategies and establishing data partnerships. Yes, initial findings and a policy brief are expected by mid-2025, with a comprehensive report and recommendations targeted for November 2025.
